# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a basic React App for admin login sessions where the User can't sign up but can only sign in using a previous set email and password.
Just the basics, nothing new here. If you're new to react and wann aknow how a basic login functionality works, this could be a good start.
Again, there is nothing much here

You login successfully if the details matches the credentials already set. Else, you won't be able to login(obv). Upon logging in succesfully you will be greeted with the name you entered. You can logout from there. That's it. Just an App to show thebasic login funtionality


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
